# Python Assignment: Files, Exception Handling, Logging, and Memory Management

This repository contains a collection of theoretical and practical questions related to **Files**, **Exception Handling**, **Logging**, and **Memory Management** in Python. The questions are sourced from an assignment document and are divided into two categories: **Theoretical Questions** and **Practical Questions**. Each category is presented in a separate table for clarity.

| 19 | What is the importance of closing a file in Python? |
| 20 | What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python? |
| 21 | What is the logging module in Python used for? |
| 22 | What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling? |
| 23 | What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python? |
| 24 | How do you raise an exception manually in Python? |
| 25 | Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications? |

## Practical Questions

These questions involve writing Python programs or implementing specific tasks related to files, exception handling, logging, and memory management.

| Question Number | Question |
|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | How can you open a file for writing in Python and write a string to it? |
| 2 | Write a Python program to read the contents of a file and print each line. |
| 3 | How would you handle a case where the file doesn't exist while trying to open it for reading? |
| 4 | Write a Python script that reads from one file and writes its content to another file. |
| 5 | How would you catch and handle division by zero error in Python? |
| 6 | Write a Python program that logs an error message to a log file when a division by zero exception occurs. |
| 7 | How do you log information at different levels (INFO, ERROR, WARNING) in Python using the logging module? |
| 8 | Write a program to handle a file opening error using exception handling. |
| 9 | How can you read a file line by line and store its content in a list in Python? |
| 10 | How can you append data to an existing file in Python? |
| 11 | Write a Python program that uses a try-except block to handle an error when attempting to access a dictionary key that doesn't exist. |
| 12 | Write a program that demonstrates using multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions. |
| 13 | How would you check if a file exists before attempting to read it in Python? |
| 14 | Write a program that uses the logging module to log both informational and error messages. |
| 15 | Write a Python program that prints the content of a file and handles the case when the file is empty. |
| 16 | Demonstrate how to use memory profiling to check the memory usage of a small program. |
| 17 | Write a Python program to create and write a list of numbers to a file, one number per line. |
| 18 | How would you implement a basic logging setup that logs to a file with rotation after 1MB? |
| 19 | Write a program that handles both `IndexError` and `KeyError` using a try-except block. |
| 20 | How would you open a file and read its contents using a context manager in Python? |
| 21 | Write a Python program that reads a file and prints the number of occurrences of a specific word. |
| 22 | How can you check if a file is empty before attempting to read its contents? |
| 23 | Write a Python program that writes to a log file when an error occurs during file handling. |
